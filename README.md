Ethical Hacking Technical Report
Client: Cyber Guard Solutions
Date: May 20, 2024

Prepared by: Deniel Genesis O. Pili

Executive Summary: This report outlines the findings of the ethical hacking assessment conducted for Cyber Guard Solutions. The assessment aimed to uncover vulnerabilities within the organization's network infrastructure, web applications, operating systems, wireless networks, and social engineering defenses. Through comprehensive testing methodologies, critical vulnerabilities were identified, necessitating immediate remediation actions to bolster the organization's cybersecurity posture.
Vulnerability Summary:
1. Network Infrastructure:

• Critical: Unpatched Apache Struts framework version 1.1.1 on Pills, susceptible to Remote Code Execution CVE-0000 -9999, enabling remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
• High: Misconfigured firewall rules on 203.128.56.78/pills, allowing unrestricted external access to critical internal services such as SSH and RDP.

2. Web Applications:

• Critical: SQL Injection vulnerability found in the login form of Deniel Pili, posing a significant risk of unauthorized database access and data extraction.

• High: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability detected in Deniel Pili, enabling attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.

3. Operating Systems:

• Critical: Outdated and unpatched Windows Server 2008 R2 operating systems on critical servers Pills, exposing them to known exploits and malware.

• High: Weak password policies observed on domain user accounts, increasing susceptibility to brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.

4. Wireless Networks:

• Critical: Usage of weak WEP encryption in wireless networks, allowing attackers to intercept and decrypt wireless traffic, leading to exposure of sensitive data.

5. Social Engineering:

• High: Multiple employees succumbed to phishing emails, resulting in the disclosure of credentials and sensitive information.

Recommendations:

1. Network Infrastructure:
• Immediately patch Apache Struts to the latest version to mitigate the Remote Code Execution vulnerability.
• Conduct a comprehensive review of firewall rules and enforce access restrictions based on the principle of least privilege.

2. Web Applications:

• Perform thorough code reviews and implement input validation mechanisms to prevent SQL Injection and XSS attacks.
• Integrate security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy) to effectively mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.

3. Operating Systems:

• Establish a robust patch management process to ensure regular updates and security patches for all operating systems, addressing known vulnerabilities promptly.
• Enforce strong password policies and consider implementing multi-factor authentication to enhance domain user account security.

4. Wireless Networks:

• Transition wireless network encryption to WPA2 or WPA3 standards to enhance confidentiality and integrity of wireless communications.

5. Social Engineering:

• Conduct regular security awareness training sessions to educate employees about the risks associated with phishing attacks and provide guidance on identifying and reporting suspicious emails.

Conclusion: The ethical hacking assessment has unveiled critical vulnerabilities and security weaknesses within Cyber Guard Solutions' infrastructure and applications. Addressing these issues promptly and implementing the recommended remediation measures are essential steps to fortifying the organization's security defenses and mitigating the risk of cyber threats and data breaches.
